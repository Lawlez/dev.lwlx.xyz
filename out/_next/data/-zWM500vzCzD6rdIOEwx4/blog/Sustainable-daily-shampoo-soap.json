It wasn't long before I was introduced to **Soeder**, a Zurich-based brand known for its natural soaps, lotions, and related products.\n\n## Why Soeder?\n\nSoeder stands out due to its commitment to sustainability and quality. Their best-seller, the \"Herbal Garden\" hand soap, is particularly popular. Not only does it have an amazing scent, but it also cleans effectively. \n\n### My Soeder Favorites\n\nI've incorporated several of their products into my daily routine:\n\n#### Soap\n- **Herbal Garden**\n- **Black Pine**\n- **Hinoki Yuzu**\n\nI use these soaps in various ways:\n- **Hand Soap**: In the bathroom and kitchen.\n- **Body Shampoo**: In the shower.\n- **Surface Cleaner**: Occasionally, to clean and freshen surfaces.\n\n### Practical and Economical\n\nI keep 500ml glass bottles in each location and usually buy the 1L refills from Galaxus. This approach is cost-effective, especially when you can get a 1L bottle for around 55.- CHF if youâ€™re lucky. You can also opt for the 5L version to save even more in the long run.\n\n### Long-Term Benefits\n\nI've been using Soeder products for about five years and couldn't be happier. I've significantly reduced my reliance on single-use plastic and minimized shopping trips. Overall, I believe this choice supports a sustainable future and saves money over time.\n\n## Pricing\n\nSoeder pricing fluctuates a lot depending on the scent and reseller:\n\n- **500ml Bottles**: Priced between 22.- to 35.- CHF per bottle.\n- **1L Refills**: Range from 52.- to 75.- CHF per bottle.\n\nSince 2022, I've purchased:\n- 3 x 500ml bottles.\n- 5 x 1L refills (two of which are still full).\n\n> To date a paid around 360.- for soeder soaps in the past 2.5 years which amounts to roughly 150.- per year. \n\nThis investment has not only helped me maintain a sustainable lifestyle but also proved to be economical in the long term.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSoeder's natural soaps are a fantastic choice for anyone looking to live more sustainably. Their products are not only high-quality but also economical in the long run. By choosing Soeder, you're supporting a brand that values the environment and promotes a sustainable future."}},"__N_SSG":true}
