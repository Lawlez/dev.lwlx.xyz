Furthermore, **/usr/share/** contains architecture-independent data. The **/usr/local/** directory is meant to be used by the administrator for installing applications manually without overwriting files handled by the packaging system (dpkg).\n- **/var/**: variable data handled by services. This includes log files, queues, spools, and caches.\n- **/proc/** and **/sys/** are specific to the Linux kernel (and not part of the FHS). The kernel uses them for exporting data to userspace."}},"__N_SSG":true}
