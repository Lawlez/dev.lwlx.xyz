It provides some nice Medium-style default styles for your blog posts and some tools for loading/rendering Markdown. But you'll have to implement your own homepage more or less from scratch. And that's the point! Don't settle for some theme. Build something that represents you.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Fork this repo\n2. ```\n   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/devii.git my-blog\n   cd my-blog\n   yarn\n   ```\n3. Start the development server with `yarn dev`. This should start a server on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## Powered by Next.js\n\nThe core of this repo is [Next.js](https://https://nextjs.org). We chose Next.js because it's the simplest, most elegant way to generate a static version of a React-based website. The documentation is excellent; read it first: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).\n\n## Project structure\n\nHere's is an abbreviated version of the project structure. Certain config files (`next.config.js`, `next-end.d.ts`, `.gitignore`) have been removed for simplicity.\n\n```\n.\n├── README.md\n├── public // all static assets (images, css, etc) go here\n├── pages // every .tsx component in this dir becomes a page of the final site\n|   ├── index.tsx // the home page (which has access to the list of all blog posts)\n|   ├── blog\n|       ├── [blog].md // a template component that renders the blog posts under `/md/blog`\n├── md\n|   ├── blog\n|       ├── devii.md // this page!\n        ├── whatever.md // every MD file in this directory becomes a blog post\n├── components\n|   ├── BlogPost.tsx\n|   ├── Code.tsx\n|   ├── Footer.tsx\n|   ├── Header.tsx\n|   ├── Markdown.tsx\n|   ├── Meta.tsx\n|   ├── <various>\n├── loader.ts // contains utility functions for loading/parsing Markdown\n├── node_modules\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── package.json\n```\n\nNext.js generates a new webpage for each file in the `pages` directory. If you want to add an About page to your blog, just add `about.tsx` inside `pages` and start writing the page.\n\nBy default the repo only contains two pages: a home page (`/pages/index.tsx`) and a blog page (`/pages/[blog].md`).\n\nThe file `[blog].ts` follows the Next.js convention of using square brackets to indicate a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\n## The home page\n\nThe home page is intentionally minimal. You can put whatever you want in `index.tsx`; one of our goals in designing dev.lwlx.xyz was to place no restrictions on the developer. Use your imagination! Your website is the online manifestion of you. You can use whatever npm packages or styling libraries you like.\n\n## Styling\n\ndev.lwlx.xyz is unopinionated about styling. Because your dev.lwlx.xyz site is a standard React app under the hood, you can use your favorite library from `npm` to do styling.\n\ndev.lwlx.xyz provides certain styles by default, notably in the Markdown renderer (`/components/Markdown.tsx`). Those styles are implemented using Next's built-in styling solution `styled-jsx`. Unfortunately it was necessary to make those styles global, since `styled-jsx` [doesn't play nice](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx/issues/573) with third-party components (in this case `react-markdown`).\n\nFeel free to re-implemement the built-in styles with your library of choice If you choose to use a separate styling library ([emotion](https://emotion.sh/) is pretty glorious) then you could re-implement the default styles\n\n## Adding a new blog post\n\nJust add a Markdown file under `md/blog/` to create a new blog post:\n\n1. Create a new Markdown file called `foo.md` within the `/md/blog` directory\n2. Add in some basic Markdown content\n3. Then go to `http://localhost:3000/blog/foo`. You should see the new post.\n\n## Frontmatter support\n\nEvery Markdown file can include a \"frontmatter block\" containing various metadata. dev.lwlx.xyz provides a `loadPost` utility that loads a Markdown file, parses it's frontmatter metadata, and returns a structured `PostData` object:\n\n```ts\ntype PostData = {\n  path: string;\n  title?: string;\n  subtitle?: string;\n  description?: string; // used for SEO\n  canonicalUrl?: string; // used for SEO\n  datePublished?: number; // Unix timestamp\n  author?: string;\n  authorPhoto?: string;\n  authorHandle?: string; // twitter handle\n  tags?: string[];\n  bannerPhoto?: string;\n  thumbnailPhoto?: string;\n};\n```\n\nFor example, here is the frontmatter blog from the sample blog post (`md/blog/the-ultimate-tech-stack.md`):\n\n```\n---\ntitle: Introducing dev.lwlx.xyz\nsubtitle: Bringing the power of React, TypeScript, and static generation to dev blogs everywhere\ndatePublished: 1589064522569\nauthor: Ben Bitdiddle\ntags:\n  - dev.lwlx.xyz\n  - Blogs\nauthorPhoto: /profile.jpg\nbannerPhoto: /brook.jpg\nthumbnailPhoto: /brook.jpg\n---\n```\n\nView `/loader.ts` to see how this works.\n\n## Google Analytics\n\nJust add your Google Analytics ID (e.g. 'UA-999999999-1') to `globals.ts` and dev.lwlx.xyz will automatically add the appropriate Google Analytics snippet to your site. Go to `/pages/_app.ts` to see how this works or customize this behavior.\n\n## Medium-inspired design\n\nThe Markdown renderer (`Markdown.tsx`) provides a default style inspired by Medium. Just modify the CSS in `Markdown.tsx` to customize the design to your liking.\n\n## GitHub-style code blocks\n\nYou can easily drop code blocks into your blog posts using triple-backtick syntax ([just like GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)). No more embedding CodePen iframes! 🚀\n\nWorks out-of-the-box for all programming languages. Specify your language with a \"language tag\". So this:\n\n  <pre>\n  ```ts\n  // pretty neat huh?\n  const test = (arg: string) => {\n    return arg.length > 5;\n  };\n  ```</pre>\n\nturns into\n\n```ts\n// pretty neat huh?\nconst test = (arg: string) => {\n  return arg.length > 5;\n};\n```\n\nView `/components/Code.tsx` to see how this works or customize this behavior.\n\n## Markdown loading\n\n_You don't need to understand all of this to use dev.lwlx.xyz. Consider this an \"advanced guide\" you can use if you want to customize the structure of the site._\n\nMarkdown posts are loaded during Next.js static build step. Check out the [Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) documentation to learn more about this.\n\nHere's the short version: if export a function called `getStaticProps` from one of your page components, Next.js will execute that function, take the result, and pass the `props` property (which should be another object) into your page as props.\n\nYou can dynamically load and parse a Markdown file using `loadMarkdownFile`, a utility function implemented in `loader.ts`. It is an async function that returns a `PostData` TypeScript object containing all the metadata keys listed above:\n\nFor an example of this, check out the `getStaticProps` implementation from the homepage. The function calls `loadBlogPosts` - a utilty function that loads _every_ blog posts in the `/md/blog/` directory, parses them, and returns `PostData[]`.\n\n```ts\nexport const getStaticProps = async () => {\n  const posts = await loadBlogPosts();\n  return { props: { posts } };\n};\n```\n\nThere are a few utility functions in `loader.ts` that dev.lwlx.xyz uses. All functions are _async_! All functions accept a _relative_ path which is expected to be \\_relative to the `md/` directory. For instance `loadPost('blog/test.md'`) would load `/md/blog/test.md`.\n\n- `loadPost` loads/parses a Markdown file and returns a `PostData`\n- `loadBlogPosts`: loads/parses all the files in `/md/blog/`. Returns `PostData[]`. Used in `index.tsx` to load/render a list of all published blog posts\n- `loadMarkdownFile`: loads a Markdown file but doesn't parse it. Returns the string content. Useful if you want to implement some parts of a page in Markdown and other parts in React\n- `loadMarkdownFiles`: accepts a [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) pattern and loads all the files inside `/md/` whose names match the pattern. Used internally by `loadBlogPosts`\n\n## Static generation\n\nYou can generate a fully static version of your site using `yarn build && yarn export`. This step is entirely powered by Next.js. The static site is exported to the `out` directory.\n\nAfter it's generated, use your static file hosting service of choice (Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting, Amazon S3) to deploy your site.\n\n## Global configs\n\nThere is a `globals.ts` file in the project root containing some settings/configuration metadata about your site:\n\n- `yourName`: Your name, used for the copyright tags in the footer and the RSS feed, e.g. Alyssa P. Hacker\n- `siteName`: The title of your blog, e.g. `Alyssa's Cool Blog`;\n- `siteDescription`: A short description, used in the `meta` description tag, e.g. 'I write about code \\'n stuff';\n- `siteCreationDate`: Used in the generated RSS feed. Use this format: 'March 3, 2020 04:00:00 GMT';\n- `twitterHandle`: The twitter handle for you or your blog/company, used in the Twitter meta tags. Include the @ symbol, e.g. '@alyssaphacker';\n- `email`: Your email, used as the \"webMaster\" and \"managingEditor\" field of the generated RSS feed, e.g. `alyssa@example.com`;\n- `url`: The base URL of your website, used to \"compute\" default canonical links from relative paths, e.g. 'https://alyssaphacker.com';\n- `accentColor`: The header and footer background color, e.g. `#4fc2b4`;\n\n## RSS feed generation\n\nAn RSS feed is auto-generated from your blog post feed. This feed is generated using the `rss` module (for converting JSON to RSS format) and `showdown` for converting the markdown files to RSS-compatible HTML.\n\nFor RSS generation to work, all your posts must contain a `datePublished` timestamp in their frontmatter metadata. To examine or customize the RSS generation, check out the `rssUtil.ts` file in the root directory.\n\n## SEO\n\nEvery blog post page automatically populated meta tags based on the post metadata. This includes a `title` tag, `meta` tags, `og:` tags, Twitter metadata, and a `link` tag containing the canonical URL.\n\nThe default value of the canonical URL is computed by concatenating the value of your `url` config (see Global Configs above) and the relative path of your post. Verify that the canonical URL is exactly equivalent to the URL in the browser when visiting your live site, otherwise your site's SEO may suffer.\n\n## Insanely customizable\n\nThere's nothing \"under the hood\" here. You can view and modify all the files that provide the functionality listed above. dev.lwlx.xyz just provides a project scaffold, some Markdown-loading loading utilities (in `loader.ts`), and some sensible styling defaults (especially in `Markdown.tsx`).\n\nTo get started customizing, check out the source code of `index.tsx` (the home page), `BlogPost.tsx` (the blog post template), and `Markdown.tsx` (the Markdown renderer).\n\nHead to the GitHub repo to get started: [https://github.com/Lawlez/dev.lwlx.xyz](https://github.com/Lawlez/dev.lwlx.xyz).
