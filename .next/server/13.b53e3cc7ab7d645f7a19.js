In fact, the\n[GitHub repo for dev.lwlx.xyz](https://github.com/Lawlez/dev.lwlx.xyz) contains the\ncode for the site you're looking at now.\n\ndev.lwlx.xyz doesn't try to be a fully functional blog out of the box. After cloning/forking the repo, you'll need to delete the contents of `index.tsx` (the page you're reading now!) and implement your own homepage. dev.lwlx.xyz makes it easier — for instance, you can access a list of all your blog posts in `props.posts` — but you still have to build the site you're imagining in your mind's eye.\n\nAnd that's the point! After you clone/fork it, look through this code to learn how dev.lwlx.xyz works. Then rip out what you don't like, customize everything else, and build your own tools and components on top of the foundation dev.lwlx.xyz provides!\n\ndev.lwlx.xyz was designed to place _zero restrictions_ on what your site can be or become. You can use any React component or styling library, pull in data from third-party APIs, even implement user accounts. Your personal website is the online manifestation of you. Don't compromise.\n");
