# Discovering Sustainable Living: Soeder's Natural Soaps

One of the first steps I took on my journey to a more sustainable lifestyle was reevaluating my choice of soap and shampoo. It wasn't long before I was introduced to **Soeder**, a Zurich-based brand known for its natural soaps, lotions, and related products.

## Why Soeder?

Soeder stands out due to its commitment to sustainability and quality. Their best-seller, the "Herbal Garden" hand soap, is particularly popular. Not only does it have an amazing scent, but it also cleans effectively. 

### My Soeder Favorites

I've incorporated several of their products into my daily routine:

#### Soap
- **Herbal Garden**
- **Black Pine**
- **Hinoki Yuzu**

I use these soaps in various ways:
- **Hand Soap**: In the bathroom and kitchen.
- **Body Shampoo**: In the shower.
- **Surface Cleaner**: Occasionally, to clean and freshen surfaces.

### Practical and Economical

I keep 500ml glass bottles in each location and usually buy the 1L refills from Galaxus. This approach is cost-effective, especially when you can get a 1L bottle for around 55.- CHF if youâ€™re lucky. You can also opt for the 5L version to save even more in the long run.

### Long-Term Benefits

I've been using Soeder products for about five years and couldn't be happier. I've significantly reduced my reliance on single-use plastic and minimized shopping trips. Overall, I believe this choice supports a sustainable future and saves money over time.

## Pricing

Soeder pricing fluctuates a lot depending on the scent and reseller:

- **500ml Bottles**: Priced between 22.- to 35.- CHF per bottle.
- **1L Refills**: Range from 52.- to 75.- CHF per bottle.

Since 2022, I've purchased:
- 3 x 500ml bottles.
- 5 x 1L refills (two of which are still full).

> To date a paid around 360.- for soeder soaps in the past 2.5 years which amounts to roughly 150.- per year. 

This investment has not only helped me maintain a sustainable lifestyle but also proved to be economical in the long term.


## Conclusion

Soeder's natural soaps are a fantastic choice for anyone looking to live more sustainably. Their products are not only high-quality but also economical in the long run. By choosing Soeder, you're supporting a brand that values the environment and promotes a sustainable future.
